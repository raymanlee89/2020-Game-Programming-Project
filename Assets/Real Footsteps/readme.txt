Each stereo sample has been meticulously recorded using 24 bit audio at 96kHz sample rate. Samples have been processed using digital compressors, EQ, and limiters to ensure that every sound is detailed and clear. Samples have short fade-ins and longer fade-outs to ensure that there is no popping or clicking present. Lastly, all files have been normalized to -1dB to ensure that all files are easy to work with in your game. 

The game-ready audio files have been converted to 16 bit audio at 44.1kHz sample rate so that their memory footprint is acceptable for even the most lightweight mobile games.
